Definition of published MiniAOD samples
=======================================

Here, we have a simple json file to give shorthand names to DAS data samples.
This tuple is used by submit_jobs.py to allow a convenient way of selecting
samples (rather than using the full DAS name). The shorthand name corresponds
to the sample name not the full dataset name (i.e. /[SampleName]/[Production]/MINIAOD*).
