# Nuke PatTools from orbit.
#
# This allow a cleaner, slimmer working area without all the PAT dependencies
# checked out.
#
# This script removes the entire PatTools directory, and makes sure that
# git doesn't complain about the removal.
#
# If you pull changes to PatTools from a remote, you'll need to rerun the
# script.
